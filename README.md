# Katie Pardee's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Front-end Web Developer working with HTML, CSS, JS(ES6), React.js, Astro, and Wordpress. I love building fast, user-friendly apps and sites.

## Features

- **No Templates**: Everything here is hand-coded and hand-designed by me. I purposefully don't use UI kits so that I can demonstrate my ability to code from scratch.
- **Optimized**: I use lighthouse to ensure this site maintains web accessiblity standards and fantastic performance metrics.
- **Mobile-first Design**: I use mobile-first design principles and ensure this site is responsive across all screen sizes.
- **Lightweight Tech Stack**: I use the Astro framework with hydrated React components where needed to maintain fast load speeds and deploy via Netlify.
